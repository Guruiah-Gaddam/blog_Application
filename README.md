Proficient in Java and Spring Framework:

Strong experience with Spring Boot for building RESTful web applications.
Extensive knowledge of Spring Data JPA for database interaction.
Entity-Relationship Modeling:

Designed and implemented entity models (User, Post, Comment) with JPA annotations to define relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-One).
CRUD Operations using Spring Data JPA:

Created repositories (JpaRepository) for automatic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for entities.
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):

Developed service layers to encapsulate business logic for user, post, and comment management.
Implemented efficient service methods for handling CRUD operations.
Database Abstraction with DAO Pattern:

Applied the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern to abstract data persistence logic.
Ensured modular and maintainable code by separating database logic from service logic.
RESTful API Development:

Built RESTful endpoints for user, post, and comment management.
Used HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interaction with client-side.
Exception Handling:

Created custom exceptions (EntityNotFoundException, EntityAlreadyExistsException) to handle application-specific error scenarios.
Implemented centralized exception handling with @RestControllerAdvice to manage and standardize error responses.
Dependency Injection with Spring:

Used Spring's @Autowired for injecting service and repository dependencies to achieve loose coupling.
Global Exception Handling:

Implemented global exception handling to catch and handle exceptions across all controllers efficiently.
Version Control:

Experience with Git for version control and collaboration on software projects.
These points highlight your technical skills, project experience, and proficiency in building a backend service using Java and Spring.
